  <h2>ValidateThisConfig Struct</h2>

<p>The framework is configured via a structure referred to as the ValidateThisConfig Struct. Each key has a default value in the framework, so if the default values match with your requirements you need not specify any keys. In that case you don&rsquo;t even have to define a ValidateThisConfig struct, as you can create the ValidateThis Facade Object without passing in a ValidateThisConfig struct.
The struct is composed of the following keys:
Core Settings
definitionPath
This key specifies the location of your rules definition files, one for each Business Object for which you want the framework to generate validations. By default it points to the /model/ folder.
The value of definitionPath can be either a physical path to the folder (e.g., C:\wwwroot\myApp\myModel) or a relative path from either the web root or a CF mapping (e.g., /myModel/).
You can specify more than one folder to search by providing them as a comma delimited list.
For more information on how ValidateThis uses the definitionPath key, see the section How ValidateThis Finds Your Rules Definition Files.
abstractGetterMethod
This key specifies the name of an abstract getter method if your objects use one. For example, some people design objects so that they have one method, e.g., getValue, which then accepts the name of a property as an argument. If your objects use an abstract getter you can specify the name of the getter via this key. The default value is getValue.
injectResultIntoBO
After server-side validations have been completed, VT can inject the Result object into your Business Object (BO), so that you can call getVTResult on your object to obtain the result. By default VT will not do this, but you can tell it to do so by setting this key to true.
defaultFailureMessagePrefix
When validations fail, both on the client-side and on the server-side, VT has a standard set of default messages that are generated. By default all of these messages are prepended with &ldquo;The &rdquo;, so a message might look like The Email Address is required. If you which to change this behaviour you can do so by providing a prefix via this key.
For example, if you set defaultFailureMessagePrefix=&ldquo;&rdquo;, the the message above would be generated as Email Address is required.
debuggingMode
There are three possible modes for debugging which is used in conjunction with the Result.getDebugging() method.
none = debugging is disabled. This is the default
info = evaluated rules / conditions and the outcome and available via the getDebugging method of the result
strict = Same as info, with the addition of XML rules being validated for compliance against the validatethis.xsd
vtFolder
This key specifies the name of the physical folder in which ValidateThis is installed. By default it programmatically determines the name, so you generally do not have to set this, even if you store the framework in a folder other than ValidateThis. It may be necessary to change this value if you are on a case-sensitive system and have installed the framework in an alternate location.
Client-Side Validation Settings
jsRoot
The framework can be asked to generate all of the JavaScript statements necessary to load and configure all of the JS libraries required for client-side validations. This key specifies where the JavaScript files can be found on your web server. By default the location is js/.
Note that the bundled jQuery client-side validation scheme does not use this setting as the libraries required are pulled from CDNs. This key has been kept in case it is needed to support alternate Javascript implementations.
defaultFormName
This key specifies the default form name/id to be used when generating client-side validations. By default the form name is frmMain. This is provided for convenience as it is easily overridable on a case by case basis. More information on specifying the form name for your client-side validations is available in the Generating Client-Side Validations section.
jsIncludes
When calling the getInitializationScript() method to generate the JavaScript required to support client-side validations, you can pass a JSIncludes argument which tells VT whether to include statements loading the required JavaScript libraries. By default the value of JSIncludes is true, but if you would prefer to override that to false for your application you may do so using this key.
defaultJSLib
This key specifies which JavaScript implementation should be used for generating client-side validations. By default it specifies the jQuery Validation Plugin, which is the only JavaScript implementation that currently ships with the framework. Because ValidateThis can be configured with support for multiple JavaScript implementations, this key allows a developer to switch implementations globally. Because there is currently only one JS implementation, there should currently be no need to specify this key.
Note that this is referred to as a Default JSLib because the framework allows you to override this value on a case-by-case basis, effectively allowing you to use multiple JS implementations in a single application.
Component Paths
ValidateThis is constructed of objects, each of which serves a particular purpose. You can change and/or extend the behaviour of the framework by providing your own objects to VT, which would normally extend VT&rsquo;s own built-in objects. The following keys allow you to specify component paths which point to your own versions of certain objects.
resultPath
This key specifies the path to the Result component, which is what is returned to you after calling validate(). By default it points to ValidateThis.util.Result. If you want to provide your own custom Result object, then specify the component path to that object in this key.
boValidatorPath
This key specifies the path to the BOValidator component, which acts as a facade between your business object and the framework. By default it points to ValidateThis.core.BOValidator. It will generally by unnecessary to override this setting.
boComponentPaths
This key specifies a list of component paths in which your Business Objects (BOs) reside. This is used in conjunction with annotation support if you wish VT to pre-load a BOValidator for each of your objects.
extraRuleValidatorComponentPaths
This key specifies a list of component paths in which external ServerRuleValidators (SRVs) can be found. If you want to extend, override or add to the internal SRV components with your own application specific versions, use this key to provide the path(s).
extraClientScriptWriterComponentPaths
This key specifies a list of component paths in which external ClientScriptWriters (CSWs) can be found. If you want to extend, override or add to the internal client-side validation components, or even create a new JavaScript implementation, this is the key to use.
extraAnnotationTypeReaderComponentPaths
This key specifies a list of component paths in which external AnnotationTypeReaders (ATRs) can be found. This will be used if you want to add support for a new annotation type. Currently JSON, XML and VTML (coming soon) are supported.
extraFileReaderComponentPaths
This key specifies a list of component paths in which external FileReaders (FRs) can be found. This will be used if you want to add support for a new external file type. Currently XML and JSON are supported. Note that this needs to be used in conjunction with the ExternalFileTypes key, discussed below.
externalFileTypes
This key specifies a list of external file types supported by the framework. The default value is xml,json. If you are adding support for a new file type via the ExtraFileReaderComponentPaths, you&rsquo;ll need to add that new type to this list as well.
Internationalization Keys
The following keys are used to configure the Internationalization (i18n) behaviour of the framework. If you are using the framework with a single language you can safely leave them out of your ValidateThisConfig struct. More information about i18n is available in the Internationalization with ValidateThis section.
translatorPath
This key specifies the path to the Translator component, which is used to translate validation failure messages. By default it points to the framework&rsquo;s BaseTranslator.cfc, which doesn&rsquo;t actually translate anything. Therefore, unless you need to support multiple languages this key does not need to be specified.
localeLoaderPath
This key specifies the path to the LocaleLoader component, which is used to load information about various language translations into the Translator. By default it points to the framework&rsquo;s BaseLocaleLoader.cfc, which doesn&rsquo;t load anything. Again, unless you need to support multiple languages this key does not need to be specified.
localeMap
This key provides a struct which contains information about which locales the application is to support, and their corresponding resource bundle property files. Prior to version 1.0 this was an empty struct, but now it must contain at least the path to the resource bundle that contains the default failure messages, so the current default value is {en_US=&lsquo;/ValidateThis/locales/en_US.properties&rsquo;}. Unless you need to support multiple languages you can leave this key untouched.
defaultLocale
This key specifies the default locale that will be used by the framework if none is passed to method calls. By default it has the value of &ldquo;en_US&rdquo;. Unless you need to support multiple languages this key does not need to be specified.</p>

<h2>How ValidateThis Finds Your Rules Definition Files</h2>

<p><strong>Configuring the Location</strong></p>

<p>ValidateThis uses the value stored in the definitionPath key of its configuration struct to decide where to look for your rules definition files. You can provide a value for that key when you initialize the framework, or simply accept the default value of /model/.</p>

<ul>
<li>This definitionPath key can be either a physical path to the folder (e.g., C:\wwwroot\myApp\myModel) or a relative path from either the web root or a CF mapping. (e.g., /myModel/).</li>
<li>You may also provide multiple paths as a comma delimited list (e.g., /myModel/, /common/model/).</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Where ValidateThis Looks for Your Files</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ValidateThis will attempt to find your Rules Definition File in the folder(s) that you specify.</li>
<li>If you specify multiple folders, it will start with the first folder in the list and keep looking until it finds a matching file.</li>
<li>When looking in a particular folder, if the framework does not find a rules definition file in the folder, it will also attempt to find the file in a subfolder with the same name as the object. For example, if the value of definitionPath is /myModel/ and you ask the framework to validate a User object, it will first look in /myModel/ and then in /myModel/User/.</li>
<li>If your object has a dotted path (e.g., model.entity.user) then VT will also translate that dotted path into a physical path to search (e.g., /model/entity/ and look for user.xml).</li>
<li>A more detailed example of locating files can be found below.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>How to Name Your Files</em></p>

<p>You can name your files either with an extension of .xml or .xml.cfm.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Example of Locating Files</strong></p>

<p>Based on all of the behaviour described above, assuming that definitionPath has a value of /myModel/, /common/model/, when you ask the framework to perform an operation on a User object, it will search in the following locations:</p>

<ol>
<li>/myModel/User.xml</li>
<li>/myModel/User.xml.cfm</li>
<li>/myModel/User/User.xml</li>
<li>/myModel/User/User.xml.cfm</li>
<li>/common/model/User.xml</li>
<li>/common/model/User.xml.cfm</li>
<li>/common/model/User/User.xml</li>
<li>/common/model/User/User.xml.cfm</li>
</ol>


<p>Note that the framework will only perform this search the first time an operation is requested on an object, after which the contents of the rules definition file will be cached within the framework.</p>
